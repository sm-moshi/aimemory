# AI Memory Extension TODO

## Core Features

-   [x] Modularise memory bank structure
-   [x] Implement robust MCP server with error handling
-   [x] Add webview UI for memory bank actions
-   [x] Migrate flat memory bank to modular structure
-   [ ] Add version control integration for memory bank files
-   [ ] Implement remote/cloud memory bank support
-   [~] Refactor extension to remove Express and use Cursor/VS Code APIs for all communication. (in progress)
-   [ ] Ensure all communication and MCP tool logic is Cursor-first (Cursor compatibility is the top priority; VS Code compatibility is a bonus).
-   [~] Add a dedicated Output Channel for AI Memory extension logs using the Cursor/VS Code API. (in progress: basic output visible, needs verbose logging and interactivity)
-   [ ] Review and analyse MCP and Developer Tools logs in `logs/` (especially `2025-05-09 15:19:50.log` and matching `vscode-app-*.log` files) for startup, error, and runtime issues.
-   [x] Rebuild and repackage the extension after refactoring (ignore files reviewed and fixed, 0.1.5 is new stable baseline).
-   [ ] Test activation, command registration, and MCP tool operation in Cursor (and optionally VS Code).
-   [ ] Document findings and next steps in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
-   [~] User-configurable log levels for Output Channel (see docs/experimental/detailed-output-with-webview.md)
-   [~] Webview error and event reporting to Output Channel (see docs/experimental/detailed-output-with-webview.md)
-   [ ] Replace `Initialize Memory Bank` with `/memory init` command

## UI/UX

-   [x] Webview: Initialise/Update Memory Bank buttons
    -   [ ] Fix "Initialise Memory Bank" button
    -   [ ] Text: Replace "Initialize Memory Bank"
-   [ ] Webview: Memory Bank: always red "missing"
-   [ ] Webview: Keep "MCP Server: Running/Stopped" status indicator in sync
-   [ ] Webview: Add a "refresh" button to the memory bank view
-   [ ] Webview: File preview and diff viewer
-   [ ] Webview: Visualise memory bank relationships
-   [~] Webview: Advanced error and status feedback (in progress)

## AI/Agent Integration

-   [x] Expose memory bank via MCP tools/resources
-   [~] Improve AI context reset and "active context" workflows (in progress)
-   [ ] Add AI-driven suggestions for memory bank updates

## Documentation

-   [x] Move all public docs to `docs/`
-   [x] Update `README.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
-   [ ] Add user/contributor guides for advanced features
-   [ ] Add screenshots and diagrams to docs

## Testing & Release

-   [x] Manual testing of migration and MCP tools
-   [ ] Add automated tests for all core features
-   [ ] Set up CI/CD for VSIX and Open VSX releases

## Community & Feedback

-   [ ] Gather user feedback for v0.2.x
-   [ ] Add community templates and extension points
