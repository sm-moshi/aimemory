## üèóÔ∏è Initial Setup

1. Install the extension.
2. Open or create a workspace folder for your project.
3. Run `AI Memory: Start MCP` from the Command Palette.
   - This creates a `memory-bank/` folder if missing.
   - Starts the MCP server (default port: 7331, fallback: 7332).
   - Updates your Cursor MCP config to connect to the server.

## üß† Using the Memory Bank

### Webview Dashboard

- Run `AI Memory: Open Dashboard` to launch the UI.
- Use buttons to initialise, update, or repair the memory bank.
- Status and error messages are shown in the dashboard.

### Memory Bank Structure

- Modular folders:
  - `memory-bank/core/`: Project brief, product context, active context
  - `memory-bank/systemPatterns/`: Architecture, patterns, scanning
  - `memory-bank/techContext/`: Stack, dependencies, environment
  - `memory-bank/progress/`: Current status, history

### MCP Tools & Commands

- Use MCP tools for automation and scripting:
  - `initialize-memory-bank`: Create all required files and structure
  - `list-memory-bank-files`: List all memory bank files
  - `get-memory-bank-file`: Get the content of a specific file
  - `update-memory-bank-file`: Update a file's content
- Use `/memory` commands in Cursor chat:
  - `/memory status`: Check memory bank status
  - `/memory list`: List all memory bank files
  - `/memory read <filename>`: Read a specific file

## üí° Best Practices & Tips

- For technical details, see [IMPLEMENTATION.md](../wip/IMPLEMENTATION.md).

> **Tip (May 2025):**
>
> - The "AI Memory: Create Memory Bank Rule" command is coming soon (logic present, not yet exposed).
> - Advanced UI features (refresh, file preview, diff viewer) are planned for future releases.
> - The extension is currently migrating away from Express for all communication. Some advanced features may be temporarily unavailable.
> - For the latest status and limitations, see [ROADMAP.md](../wip/ROADMAP.md).
