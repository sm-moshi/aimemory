STEPS:
1. Read the Cursor rules at .cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc to understand the Memory Bank structure
2. Create all required Memory Bank files with appropriate initial content for this project
3. Document the project goals, context, and technical details based on what you know
4. Once you've created the Memory Bank files, call the load-memory-bank-files tool to complete initialization

This is critical for maintaining project context between sessions. Please start immediately.`;
