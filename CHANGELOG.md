Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

## [Unreleased]

- Initial release

## [0.1.2] - 2025-05-09

### Packaging & Workflow Improvements üêπ

- Fixed VSIX packaging to strictly exclude `.cursor/`, `memory-bank/`, `docs/`, and `test/` folders using hard excludes in `.vscodeignore`.
- Ensured only `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and built extension assets are included in the VSIX.
- Updated `Justfile` with a robust `ship` function: now runs `pnpm install` and `npm install --omit=dev` before packaging, and verifies VSIX contents with `vsce ls --tree`.
- Confirmed extension runs in Extension Development Host Mode for safe testing and development.
- Improved documentation and workflow for privacy and reproducibility in packaging.
