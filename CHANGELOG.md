## [Unreleased]

**Logging, Output, and Robustness Improvements** üêπ

- **Verbose Logging**
  - Added verbose logging to the Output Channel in the memory bank service and core logic.
  - Logs all major actions (file loads, updates, checks, method calls, and errors) for improved debugging and traceability.
  - Output Channel feature is in progress: basic output is visible, verbose logging is implemented, further interactivity and UI feedback are planned.

- **Webview Feedback**
  - The "Reset the rules" button in the webview now provides user feedback and error handling for all code paths (success, user cancel, error).
  - Improved user notifications and logging for rule resets and memory bank repairs.

- **Ruleset & Self-Healing**
  - The ruleset and `.mdc` file are now up-to-date; self-healing is robust and automatic.
  - MCP tool usage is now enforced and documented in the rules.

- **Documentation**
  - Updated `TODO.md` and `ROADMAP.md` to reflect current progress, robust self-healing, and logging improvements.
  - Clarified the use of MCP tools and the importance of tool-assisted reasoning in the rules.

- **Refactoring**
  - Continued refactor to remove Express and use Cursor/VS Code APIs for all communication (in progress).
  - Improved modularity and context-agnostic design in memory bank core logic.

## [0.1.5] - 2025-05-11

**Packaging & Ignore Rules Fixes** üêπ

- Reviewed and optimised `.npmignore`, `.vscodeignore`, and `.cursorignore` to ensure only necessary files are included in VSIX and npm packages.
- Fixed previous issues where packaging or ignore rules caused the extension to break or exclude required files.
- Successfully built and packaged version 0.1.5; the VSIX is now clean, minimal, and includes only runtime essentials.
- 0.1.5 is now the new stable baseline for further development and release.

---

## [0.1.4] - 2025-05-10

**Major Changes & Features** üêπ

- Modular memory bank structure: files grouped by context (core, systemPatterns, techContext, progress)
- Self-healing: missing or incomplete files are auto-created from templates
- Improved error feedback: Output Channel and webview now show clear repair/status messages
- Webview UI: new "Repair Memory Bank" button, improved feedback, and robust status checks
- MCP server: hardened with readiness checks, port failover, and better error handling
- `/memory status` and webview now surface self-healing and repair actions
- Documentation and troubleshooting guides updated for migration and new workflows

**Migration & Compatibility**

- Migration guide drafted in memory bank: see `progress/current.md` for upgrade steps
- Backwards compatible with most flat memory banks, but modularisation is recommended
- All major actions and errors now logged for easier debugging

## [0.1.2] - 2025-05-09

**Packaging & Workflow Improvements** üêπ

- Fixed VSIX packaging to strictly exclude `.cursor/`, `memory-bank/`, `docs/`, and `test/` folders using hard excludes in `.vscodeignore`.
- Ensured only `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and built extension assets are included in the VSIX.
- Updated `Justfile` with a robust `ship` function: now runs `pnpm install` and `npm install --omit=dev` before packaging, and verifies VSIX contents with `vsce ls --tree`.
- Confirmed extension runs in Extension Development Host Mode for safe testing and development.
- Improved documentation and workflow for privacy and reproducibility in packaging.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-09

**Experimental & In-Progress** üêπ

- Added a dedicated Output Channel for AI Memory extension logs to improve diagnostics and user feedback.
- Updated TODO and ROADMAP with a robust, Cursor-first action plan for startup, error handling, and MCP tool reliability.
- Planned and prepared for retry/backoff logic, JSON validation, and deferred activation for MCP server connection.
- Improved project documentation to clarify modular memory bank structure and workflows.
- Minor cleanups and preparation for further refactoring (Express removal, command queuing, etc.).
- This version is running in the Extension Development Host, but is not yet fully stable for production use.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-09

**Major Changes & Features** üêπ

- Refactored memory bank to a modular, async, and robust structure with readiness checks and error handling
- Hardened MCP server: automatic port failover, robust error handling, and readiness checks for all endpoints
- Modernised webview UI: added "Initialise Memory Bank" and "Update Memory Bank" buttons, clear feedback, and error handling
- Reduced bundle size by marking large dependencies as external in the build config
- Improved developer experience: clearer feedback, robust error messages, and up-to-date documentation
- Updated documentation: `README.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, and this changelog
- All code and docs now use British English and follow project rules (emoji, GitFlow, etc.)
- All linter and type errors resolved; tests pass successfully

**Fixes & Improvements**

- Fixed asset and markdown copying in build process
- Ensured all MCP tools and webview actions fail gracefully if memory bank is not ready
