**Comprehensive Refactor & Cursor-First Improvements** üêπ

- **Build & Config**
  - Unified and cleaned up TypeScript configs, build scripts (esbuild for Node/extension/server, Vite for webview), and ignore files.
  - Removed unnecessary dependencies, deduplicated scripts, and ensured all build/test/dev commands are documented in `README.md`.

- **MCP Server & Memory Bank**
  - Migrated from Express/HTTP to Cursor/VS Code APIs and stdio transport for core operations.
  - Refactored MCP tool and resource registration for both extension and CLI/server, ensuring feature parity and compliance (including per-file resource access).

  - Implemented health/status commands (`/memory health`), self-healing, and robust file/folder checks.
  - Updated command handler to support `/memory init`, `/memory health`, and other commands, with clear help text.

- **Logging, Output, and Diagnostics**
  - Added `aimemory.showOutput` command to show the Output Channel in the extension.
  - Verbose logging for all major actions (file loads, updates, checks, method calls, and errors) for improved debugging and traceability.
  - Output Channel feature: basic output is visible, verbose logging is implemented, further interactivity and UI feedback are planned.

- **Webview & UI/UX**
  - Updated React webview to use new tool names, fixed button labels, and improved feedback for memory bank actions.
  - Enhanced status indicators and ensured UI reflects backend state.
  - The "Reset the rules" button in the webview now provides user feedback and error handling for all code paths.
  - Improved user notifications and logging for rule resets and memory bank repairs.

- **Ruleset & Self-Healing**
  - The ruleset and `.mdc` file are now up-to-date; self-healing is robust and automatic.
  - MCP tool usage is now enforced and documented in the rules.

- **Bugfixes & Diagnostics**

  - Diagnosed and resolved issues with command interception by Cursor's default AI agent.
  - Ensured per-file resource registration for full MCP compliance.

- **Documentation & Roadmap**
  - Updated `TODO.md` and `ROADMAP.md` to reflect current progress, robust self-healing, and logging improvements.
  - Highlighted upcoming features: chunked file access, metadata tools, rule-bound validation, advanced UI, and automated testing/CI.

- **User Experience**
  - Ensured all changes are idiomatic, maintainable, and follow KISS/DRY principles.
  - Prioritised Cursor-first operation, with VS Code compatibility as a bonus.
  - Provided clear, actionable summaries and next steps throughout.

- **Memory Bank Update**
  - Used the summary to update `memory-bank/progress/current.md` with a detailed progress log and next steps.
