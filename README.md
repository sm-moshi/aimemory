# AI Memory Extension for Cursor üêπ

## Overview

AI Memory is a modular, robust, and user-friendly extension for Cursor (0.50+) and VS Code, providing persistent, context-aware memory for LLMs and agents. It features a modern webview, a stable MCP server (CLI/stdio), and a fully modular, self-healing memory bank system. Designed Cursor-first, it ensures seamless context retention, robust error handling, and a smooth developer experience.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Modular Memory Bank**: Structured folders (`core/`, `systemPatterns/`, `techContext/`, `progress/`) for project, product, technical, and progress context.
- **MCP Server (CLI/stdio)**: Robust, async, error-tolerant, and Cursor-first. Automatic port failover and readiness checks.
- **Webview UI**: Initialise, update, and repair the memory bank with clear feedback and error messages.
- **Self-Healing**: Auto-creates missing files/folders from templates. Manual repair available via webview.
- **Migration Logic**: Detects and migrates flat memory banks to modular structure with user consent.
- **/memory Commands**: Interact directly with the memory bank from Cursor chat (e.g., `/memory status`, `/memory list`, `/memory read <filename>`).
- **Version Control Ready**: Modular structure supports future versioning, remote/cloud, and visualisation features.

## üóÇ Project Structure

- `src/` ‚Äî Modular TypeScript source (core logic, MCP server, webview, types, utils, tests, assets)
- `memory-bank/` ‚Äî Modular, persistent project memory (see below)
- `docs/` ‚Äî Public documentation, guides, and plans
- `dist/` ‚Äî Packaged extension and assets

### Modular Memory Bank Structure

| Folder            | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `core/`           | Project brief, product context, active context |
| `systemPatterns/` | System architecture, design patterns, scanning |
| `techContext/`    | Tech stack, dependencies, environment          |
| `progress/`       | Progress index, current work, history          |

All required files are auto-created if missing. See [memory-bank rules](memory-bank/core/projectbrief.md) for details.
