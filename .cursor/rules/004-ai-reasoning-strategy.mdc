# AI Reasoning Strategy Rules

## Core Principle

**Model-Agnostic Reasoning Strategy**: Advanced models (Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash, ChatGPT o4-mini) can strategically choose between native thinking and MCP tools based on complexity and impact. Models without native reasoning capabilities should use validated MCP clear-thought tools to achieve similar systematic thinking and planning abilities for complex problems.

**Research Validation** ‚úÖ: All referenced MCP tools have been validated as actively developed, production-ready systems with proven track records.

## üß† Native Capabilities (Use For)

### Routine Development Tasks
- Code reviews and basic bug fixes
- Applying well-established patterns (React hooks, TypeScript types)
- Standard configuration changes
- Simple explanations and documentation
- Following documented best practices

### Clear Domain Knowledge
- Answering questions about technologies in training data
- Making straightforward architectural decisions
- Basic troubleshooting and debugging
- Standard linting/formatting decisions

### Quick Analysis
- Reading code and identifying obvious issues
- Simple refactoring suggestions
- Applying known patterns and conventions
- Immediate technical responses

### Complex Decision Making Framework
```typescript
const shouldUseStructuredThinking = {
  complexity: "Multi-faceted problems with trade-offs",
  uncertainty: "Ambiguous requirements or unclear outcomes",
  impact: "High-stakes decisions affecting architecture",
  validation: "Need to check reasoning for blind spots",
  exploration: "Multiple valid approaches to consider",
  currentInfo: "Requires up-to-date documentation or patterns"
}
```

## üéØ Enhanced Implementation Guidelines

### When to Escalate to MCP Tools
1. **Multiple Valid Solutions**: When there are 3+ viable approaches
2. **High Impact**: Changes affecting >50% of codebase or core architecture
3. **Uncertainty**: Requirements are ambiguous or evolving
4. **Time Pressure**: Need to validate approach before significant investment
5. **Learning Opportunity**: Complex problems that benefit from explicit reasoning
6. **Documentation Currency**: Need current information beyond training data
7. **Best Practices Validation**: Ensuring compliance with industry standards

### Tool Selection Strategy
- **Start Simple**: Use native reasoning first for quick assessment
- **Escalate Strategically**: Move to clear-thought when complexity threshold reached
- **Research When Needed**: Use Context7 for current information
- **Document Reasoning**: Always explain why specific tools were chosen
- **Share Process**: Let users see the structured reasoning when valuable

### Practical Integration Patterns ‚úÖ

#### Research-Informed Decision Making
```markdown
1. Native assessment ‚Üí Quick feasibility check
2. Clear-thought planning ‚Üí Structured approach development
3. Context7 research ‚Üí Validate with current documentation
4. Implementation ‚Üí Apply validated patterns
5. Memory bank update ‚Üí Document insights for future reference
```
