# Cursor Memory Bank Rules (AI Memory v0.8.0+)

Welcome to the AI Memory system. This file acts as the blueprint for how Cursor understands and works with your Memory Bank. It will be transformed automatically into `.cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc` by the AI Memory extension on first initialization.

## 🧠 Reset & Load

- On every session reset, run `read-memory-bank-files()`
- Always load:
  - `core/*.md`
  - `progress/current.md`, `progress/history.md`
  - `systemPatterns/index.md`
  - `techContext/index.md`  # Only this tech file is created on init
- Other files are loaded lazily or created on demand when contextually required.
- Failover and retry logic should be applied if a file is missing or corrupted.

## 🔥 Memory Tiering

| Tier | Files                              | Access Rule               |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Hot  | `core/*.md`, `progress/current.md` | Always load immediately   |
| Warm | `systemPatterns/index.md`          | Load on plan or diagnosis |
| Cold | >30KB files, old history           | Load chunked or deferred  |

## 📏 File Size Guidelines

- `< 15KB`: Load freely
- `15–30KB`: Warn, consider chunking
- `> 30KB`: Chunked access required via `chunkIndex`
- Limit to 5 parallel loads
- Warn if more than 8 files are read in parallel

## 🔐 Safety Rules

- Never overwrite `projectBrief.md` or `productContext.md`
- NEVER write to any `index.md` file
- Always prompt before modifying `progress/current.md`
- CHUNK read required for any file > 30KB
- NEVER DELETE any memory-bank file without explicit user approval
- Mark all dangerous operations in logs and surface in UI if available

## 📂 Memory Bank Structure

    CORE --> AC[activeContext.md]

    subgraph Modules
      SP_IDX[systemPatterns/index.md]
      SP_IDX --> SP_ARCH[architecture.md]
      SP_IDX --> SP_PTRN[patterns.md]
      SP_IDX --> SP_SCAN[scanning.md]

      TC_IDX[techContext/index.md]
      TC_IDX -.-> TC_STACK[stack.md]
      TC_IDX -.-> TC_DEPS[dependencies.md]
      TC_IDX -.-> TC_ENV[environment.md]
      %% Dashed lines: created on demand

      PR_IDX[progress/index.md]
      PR_IDX --> PR_CUR[current.md]
      PR_IDX --> PR_HIST[history.md]
    end
```

- Only `techContext/index.md` is created on initialization.
- The other tech files are generated if/when the user or AI requests more detailed separation.

## 🧭 Plan Mode

- `plannerMode: true`
- Use `getPlanSummary()` to scan `activeContext.md` and `current.md`
- ALWAYS ask 4–6 clarifying questions before proposing a new plan
- Validate all assumptions against `productContext.md`
- Present plan clearly and apply using `update-memory-bank-file()`
- NEVER edit or overwrite without explicit user confirmation

## 🛠 Core MCP Tools

| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `init-memory-bank()`              | Initialize memory bank folders and files |
| `read-memory-bank-files()`        | Full memory scan on session reset        |
| `update-memory-bank-file()`       | Update file contents safely              |
| `list-memory-bank-files()`        | List files with metadata                 |
| `health-check-memory-bank()`      | Check memory bank health status          |
| `read-memory-bank-file()`         | Read single file by type (CLI mode)      |
| `review-and-update-memory-bank()` | Interactive file review workflow         |

## 🔍 Advanced MCP Tools (Phase 2)

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `query-memory-index()`       | Search files by metadata and content |
| `validate-memory-file()`     | Validate file against schema         |
| `rebuild-metadata-index()`   | Force rebuild search index           |
| `get-metadata-for-file()`    | Get detailed file metadata           |
| `get-metadata-index-stats()` | Get search index statistics          |

## 🧠 Notes for Cursor Agent Developers

- Enforce safety rules in UI interactions and MCP tools.
- Use metadata to filter large or outdated files.
- Confirm edits and deletions through prompts or modals.
- Cross-check edits against `core/activeContext.md` and `productContext.md` when `plannerMode` is enabled.

## 🛠️ Thoughtful Use of Available MCP Tools

To ensure robust, up-to-date, and best-practice solutions when working with the memory bank or extension, the AI agent should thoughtfully use all available MCP tools in this environment, including but not limited to:

- **clear-thought**: For step-by-step, chain-of-thought reasoning, planning, and hypothesis validation. Use this tool to break down complex problems, validate plans, and check for missed edge cases.
- **context7**: For accessing official documentation, best practices, code examples, and checking for deprecations or usage patterns in libraries and frameworks.

### Guidelines

- Use these tools whenever reasoning about complex changes, validating plans, or when up-to-date information is required.
- Prefer tool-assisted reasoning over assumptions, especially for ambiguous or high-impact tasks.
- Document in the memory bank when a tool was used to inform a decision or plan.
- If the user requests, always use the specified tool for their query.

This ensures that all memory bank operations and extension development are grounded in the best available knowledge and practices.

## Implementation Notes & Best Practices

- Self-healing: The extension will auto-create any missing required files/folders on startup or access, using templates. This is considered safe and does not require user consent.
- Consent for sensitive operations: All file overwrites (except self-healing) require user consent. `memory-bank.mdc` may only be regenerated or overwritten with explicit user consent.

This file will be read by `cursor-rules-service.ts` and compiled into a `.mdc` format for rule execution.

Cursor agents should regularly check the .cursor/rules/ directory for other rulesets that may affect project behaviour.
